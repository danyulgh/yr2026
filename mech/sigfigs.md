	* yes decimal, yes they count
		* 3.0 x 10^4 (2 sigfigs), 30,000. (5 sigfigs)
	* no decimal, no zeros count (use scientific notation as above to make them count)
		* 30,000 kg (1 sigfig)
* multiplying/dividing, keep lowest
* adding/subtracting, keep least place value with information
	* 3.17 + 2.4 = 5.6
