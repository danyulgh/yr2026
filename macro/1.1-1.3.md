# intro
* economy is the system that coordinates productive activities
	* these activities create the goods and services people want and get them to the people
* economics, a social science
	* studies production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services
* market economy
	* production and consumption are the result of decentralized decisions
	* no central authority
	* United States is an example
* command economy (alternative to market)
	* there is a central authority
	* havent worked very well
		* producers had lack of materials
		* people didnt want the products
	* Soviet Union was an example
* invisible hand
	* when the way a market economy manages to harness the power of self-interest for the good of society
* microeconomics
	* how individuals make decisions and how these decisions interact
	* pursuit of self-interests promote society's interests too 
* market failure
	* when pursuit of self-interest makes society worse off
	* traffic congestion, pollution, natural resource exploitation
* recessions
	* economy does not always run smoothly; there are fluctuations
	* a recession is a downturn in the economy
	* severe recessions -> millions of laid off workers
* macroeconomics
	* concerned with overall ups and downs in the economy
* economic growth
	* the growing ability of the economy to produce goods and services
# 1.1
* individual choice
	* decisions by an individual about what to do and not to do
	* the most basic level of economic issues
		* manufacturer chose to produce
		* store chose to display
		* you chose to buy/look
	* if theres no choice, its not economics
* resouce
	* anything that can be used to produce something else
		* land, labor (time of workers), capital, human capital (educational achievements/skills)
	* they are *scarce* when there's not enough resource to satisfy demand
* opportunity cost
	* what you must give up to get what you want
		* giving up free tennis for $750 jazz -> the opportunity cost is tennis & spending $750 in other things
* decision at the margin (marginal decisions)
	* represents "how much" decisions (not "either-or")
		* rather than it being "should i take either econ or chem?" its "how much should i spend on econ and how much on chem?"
		* in reality its more like "what to do with your next \_\_\_\_ (hour, dollar, etc.)"
	* the decision involves a trade-off
	* marginal analysis is the study of these decisions
* trade-off
	* a comparison of costs and benefits of doing something
* incentive
	* anything that offers rewards to people who change their behavior
	* people often exploit opportunities to make themselves better off until they have been fully exhausted
# 1.2
* trade
	* people provide goods and services and receive goods and services in return
* gains from trade
	* people can get more of what they want than if they were self-sufficient
	* this is thanks to division of tasks
* specialization
	* different people engage in different tasks
* equilibrium
	* an economic situation
	* no individual would be better off doing something else
* efficient
	* an economy is efficient if it takes all opportunities to make some people better off without making other people worse off
	* all resources are fully exploited
* equity 
	* everyone gets their fair share
# 1.3
* one persons spending is another person's income
* comparative advantage 
	* a country could produce goods even cheaper at home but imports it instead due to a high opportunity cost  
* absolute advantage
	* a country manufactures / produces a good due to eat being the best to produce there  
* opportunity cost 
	* divide time it takes to produce item by time it takes to produce the trade-off item   
* country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage for that good  
* mutually beneficial trade
	* two countries with comparatively advantageous production lines trade with each other and there is decent consumption of said item  
* division of labor
	* labor is divided between various different parts  
* specialization 
	* there is much division of labor and trade to ensure that each group has the items necessary
